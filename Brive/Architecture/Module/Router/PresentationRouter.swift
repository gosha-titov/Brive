/// A presentation router that owns child routers.
///
/// The `PresentationRouter` class defines the shared behavior thatâ€™s common to parent routers.
/// You rarely create instances of the `PresentationRouter` class directly.
/// Instead, you subclass it and add the methods and properties needed to manage the module.
///
/// The router's main responsibility is to activate and deactivate the module. The implementation is hidden,
/// but if you want to perform any additional work, override ``routerDidActivate()``
/// and ``routerWillDeactivate()`` methods.
///
/// The router can receive some data from its parent before being displayed.
/// To handle this, override ``receive(_:)`` method.
///
/// In order to complete this module and show the parent one,
/// call ``complete(with:unloaded:animated:)`` method.
///
/// **The essence of a parent router is to own child modules and route to them.**
///
/// Each child router is attached to its module. Use `Enumeration` to create modules as it's done in the example:
///
///     enum SomeModule { case feed, messages, settings }
///
/// Pay attention, that the router and builder modules are the same.
///
/// You can handle result of a child module's completion by overriding the ``childDidComplete(_:with:)`` method.
///
/// Use ``present(module:with:animated:completion:)`` method to present a child module modally.
/// The ``route(to:with:)`` method of `Routing` protocol that does the same thing.
