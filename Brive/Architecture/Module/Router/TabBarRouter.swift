/// A tab bar router that owns child routers.
///
/// The `TabBarRouter` class defines the shared behavior thatâ€™s common to all tab bar routers.
/// You rarely create instances of the `TabBarRouter` class directly.
/// Instead, you subclass it and add the methods and properties needed to manage the module.
///
/// The router's main responsibility is to activate and deactivate the module. The implementation is hidden,
/// but if you want to perform any additional work, override ``routerDidActivate()``
/// and ``routerWillDeactivate()`` methods.
///
/// The router can receive some data from its parent before being displayed.
/// To handle this, override ``receive(_:)`` method.
///
/// **The essence of a parent router is to own child modules and route to them.**
///
/// Each child router is attached to its module. Use `Enumeration` to create modules as it's done in the example:
///
///     enum SomeModule { case feed, messages, settings }
///
/// Pay attention, that the router and builder `Module` structs are the same.
///
/// The navigation router uses a tab bar controller that manages a multiselection interface,
/// where the selection determines which child view controller to display.
///
/// You need to set tab bar modules before this module is activated, do it as in the example:
///
///     router.tabBar = [.feed, .messages, .settings]
///
/// You have two kind of transition to child modules:
/// - use ``select(module:with:)`` method to switch to the module, but it doesn't work with unspecified modules,
/// + use ``present(module:with:animated:completion:)`` method to present a child module modally.
///
/// Or you can use ``route(to:with:)`` method of `Routing` protocol that calls the first method.
///
