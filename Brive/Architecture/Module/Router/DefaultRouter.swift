/// The `DefaultRouter` class defines the shared behavior thatâ€™s common to all routers.
/// You almost always subclass the `DefaultRouter` but you rarely implement it,
/// since each router has already organized flow logic between modules.
/// You usually do this as in the example below:
///
///     final class SettingsRouter: DefaultRouter<SettingsInteractor> {}
///
/// But if you need to, then subclass it and add the methods and properties to manage the router.
///
/// The router's lifecycle is loading and unloading. The implementation is hidden,
/// but if you need to perform any additional work, override ``routerDidLoad()``
/// and ``routerWillUnload()`` methods.
///
/// In order to complete this module and display the parent one,
/// call ``complete(with:animated:shouldKeepModuleLoaded:)`` method.
///
