/// A navigation router that owns child routers.
///
/// The `NavigationRouter` class defines the shared behavior thatâ€™s common to all navigation routers.
/// You almost always subclass the `NavigationRouter` but you rarely implement it,
/// since each router has already organized flow logic between modules.
/// You usually do this as in the example below:
///
///     final class SettingsRouter: NavigationRouter<SettingsInteractor, SettingsBuilder> {}
///
/// But if you need to, then subclass it and add the methods and properties to manage the router.
///
/// The router's lifecycle is loading and unloading. The implementation is hidden,
/// but if you need to perform any additional work, override ``routerDidLoad()``
/// and ``routerWillUnload()`` methods.
///
/// In order to complete this module and display the parent one,
/// call ``complete(with:animateTransition:shouldKeepModuleLoaded:)`` method.
///
/// The navigation router uses a navigation controller, that is, its view is embedded in the navigation interface.
/// If you need to modify this interface, use `navigationController` property.
///
/// A navigation router can transite to child module in two ways:
/// - use ``present(module:with:animated:completion:)`` method to present a child module modally,
/// + use ``push(module:with:animated:)`` method to push a child module onto the navigation stack.
///
