/// A parent interactor which module owns child modules.
///
/// The `ParentInteractor` class defines the shared behavior thatâ€™s common to all parent interactors.
/// You rarely create instances of the `ParentInteractor` class directly.
/// Instead, you subclass it and add the methods and properties needed to manage the business logic of this module.
///
/// If this module should have an associated `View`, then use the `ViewOwnable` protocol.
///
/// The interactor's lifecycle consists of activation and deactivation. The implementation is hidden,
/// but if you need to perform any additional work, override ``interactorDidActivate()``
/// and ``interactorWillDeactivate()`` methods.
///
/// When a parent interactor is about to display this module, it can pass some input data.
/// To handle this, override ``parent(willDisplayModuleWith:)`` method.
///
/// The parent interactor can pass some data to this interactor while it's activated.
/// To handle this, override ``parent(didPass:)`` method.
///
/// When a child module completes, it can pass some output data.
/// To handle this, override ``child(_:didCompleteWith:)`` method.
///
/// The child interactor can pass some data to this interactor while it's activated.
/// To handle this, override ``child(_:didPass:)`` method.
///
/// In order to pass some data to the parent module, call ``pass(_:to:)`` method.
