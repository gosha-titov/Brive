/// Instead, you subclass it and add the methods and properties needed to manage the business logic of this module.

/// If this module should have an associated `View`, then use the ``ViewOwnable`` protocol.

/// The interactor's lifecycle consists of activation and deactivation, but in the interval between them,

/// and/or ``interactorWillDeactivate()`` methods.
///
/// The ``state`` property is indicating the current state of the interactor.
/// There're three possible states: `active`, `suspended` or `inactive`.
///
/// When a parent interactor is about to display this module, it can pass some input data.
/// To handle this, override ``parent(willDisplayModuleWith:)`` method.
///
/// The parent interactor can pass some data to this interactor while it's activated.
/// To handle this, override ``parent(didPass:)`` method.
///
/// In order to pass some data to the parent module, call ``pass(_:to:)`` method.
