/// The implementation is hidden, but if you need to perform any additional work,
/// override ``moduleDidActivate()``, ``moduleWillSuspend()``, ``moduleDidResume()``
/// and/or ``moduleWillDeactivate()`` methods.
///
/// The `state` property is indicating the current state of the module that is active or inactive.
///
/// When a parent module is about to display this module, it can pass some input data.
/// To handle this, override ``parent(willDisplayModuleByPassing:)`` method.

/// To handle this, override ``parent(didPass:)`` method.
///
/// In order to pass some data to a parent module, call ``pass(_:to:)`` method.
