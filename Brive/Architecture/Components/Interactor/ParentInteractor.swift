/// A parent interactor which module owns child modules.
///
/// The `ParentInteractor` class defines the shared behavior thatâ€™s common to all parent interactors.
/// You never create instances of the `ParentInteractor` class directly.
/// Instead, you subclass it and add the methods and properties needed to manage the business logic of this module.
///
/// If this module should not have an associated `View`, then use the ``NonViewing`` protocol as in the example below:
///
///     class SomeInteractor: ParentInteractor<..., NonViewing, ...>
///
/// The module's lifecycle consists of: activation and deactivation, but between them there can also be suspening and resuming.
/// The implementation is hidden, but if you need to perform any additional work,
/// override ``moduleDidActivate()``, ``moduleWillSuspend()``, ``moduleDidResume()``
/// and/or ``moduleWillDeactivate()`` methods.
///
/// The `state` property is indicating the current state of the module that is active or inactive.
///
/// When a parent module is about to display this module, it can pass some input data.
/// To handle this, override ``parent(willDisplayModuleByPassing:)`` method.
///
/// A parent module can pass some data to this module while it's active.
/// To handle this, override ``parent(didPass:)`` method.
///
/// When a child module completes, it can pass some output data.
/// To handle this, override ``child(_:didCompleteByPassing:)`` method.
///
/// A child module can pass some data to this module while it's active.
/// To handle this, override ``child(_:didPass:)`` method.
///
/// In order to pass some data to a parent or child module, call ``pass(_:to:)`` method.
