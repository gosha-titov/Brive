/// since each router has already organized flow logic between modules.
/// You usually do this as in the example below:
///
///     final class SomeRouter: DefaultRouter {}
///
/// The `state` property is indicating the current state of the module.
/// There are only two possible states: active and inactive.
///
/// In order to complete this module and display the parent one, call
/// the ``complete(byPassing:animated:shouldKeepModuleLoaded:)`` method.
///
/// If the module is presented, then you can set the block to execute after the module is dismissed.
/// Use `dismissingCompletion` property to do this.
///
